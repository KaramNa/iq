    <h1>Instructions for solving "Complete the Figure" questions</h1>
    <p>When faced with a "Complete the Figure" question, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Look at the given figures and try to identify a pattern or rule that governs their shape.</li>
        <li>Determine what shape is missing from the incomplete figure.</li>
        <li>Apply the pattern or rule you identified earlier to determine what the missing shape should be.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Here are some examples of the types of patterns that could be used:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Symmetry:</strong> The figure may be symmetrical along one or more axes.</li>
        <li><strong>Rotation:</strong> The figure may include elements that rotate or turn in a specific direction.</li>
        <li><strong>Size and orientation:</strong> The size or orientation of the figures may change in a particular
            way.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Color or shading:</strong> The figures may include different colors or shading patterns that follow
            a specific sequence.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>By following these instructions and looking for patterns in the figures, you should be able to approach "Complete
        the Figure" questions with greater confidence and understanding.</p>
